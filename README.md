# Machine-Learning

The House Price Prediction project used the data near California. The dataset was visualised using various scatterplots and histograms, it was then preprocessed - imputation (SimpleImputer), encoding (ordinal, one-hot, label encoding), feature scaling (StandardScalar, MinMaxScalar), use of redial basis function (RBF) to compute similarity, transformation pipelines, trained using linear regression, decision tree regressor, fine tuning via Grid Search and Randomized search and finally evaluated on test set.
